                    <p>I'm Joe. For as long as I can remember, engineering and design has been in my blood. As a young kid, I was fascinated with the inner workings of pendulum clocks, won statewide LEGO robotics competitions, and got sufficiently into both large-scale hobby rocketry and combat robotics to give my family some good scares. As an engineering student, I have focused my enthusiasm towards

                    <p>Mechanical design, in particular linkage/mechanism development, from initial kinematic synthesis up through detailed design for manufacturability and production, is my specialty and passion. However, </p>

                    <p>Whether it's enabling me to more fully understand the context of my small piece of a project's role in a complex system, , or allowing me to oversee systems development and integration for sophisticated multidisciplinary robotics projects,

                        <p>In a project I had been looking forwards to since seeing the course title "Spacecraft and Mission Design" in the WPI catalog, I worked in a team of four students to generate a first order self consistent design proposal for all major subsystems of an interplanetary orbital mission, with the ultimate goal of providing imaging of Mars' moon Phobos by inserting the MRO HiRISE camera into a trailing orbit. Component choices for propulsion, power, attitude control, structure, and launch subsystems were all specified in detail, working around hard constraints imposed by other subsystems which were considered beyond project scope. Extensive mass budgetary analysis was performed to ensure a self-consistent solution which could perform all required maneuvers and functionality. Competing with five other teams within the class, our design proposal scored the highest, achieving all mission objectives with the lowest overall wet mass and highest average component TRL.</p>
