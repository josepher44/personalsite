                    <h2 id="scrolltrigger">Maker of Many Things. Cross-disciplinary Engineer. Linkage Nerd. </h2>





                    <p style="font-size: 15px">I'm Joe. For as long as I can remember, engineering and design has been in my blood. As a young kid, I was fascinated with the inner workings of pendulum clocks, won statewide LEGO robotics competitions, and got sufficiently into both large-scale hobby rocketry and combat robotics to give my family some good scares. As an engineering student, I have focused my enthusiasm towards a double major in mechanical and robotics engineering from Worcester Polytechnic Institute, with additional concentrations in manufacturing and aerospace engineering. As a professional, I'm looking forwards to discovering new ways I can apply my extensive project experience towards taking on huge problems. 

                    <p style="font-size: 15px">Mechanical design, in particular linkage/mechanism development, from initial kinematic synthesis up through detailed design for manufacturability and production, has become my specialty and passion. However, I pride myself on my multidisciplinary background, and drive to continue learning skills across all engineering disciplines as my work requires, or just because they spark something in me. Whether it's enabling me to more fully understand the context of my small piece of a project's role within a complex system, or allowing me to oversee systems development and integration for sophisticated multidisciplinary robotics projects, or just helping me put out all manner of developmental fires on demand, my broad knowledge base, dynamic nature, and desire to learn all I can helps me bring unique and well-rounded perspectives to everywhere I work. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p style="font-size: 15px">I find unreal levels of excitement in the process of diving wholeheartedly into intimidating projects, creating something new where there was nothing, and seeing designs come to life. I love nothing more than sharing this excitement with the people I work with, and discovering all the incredible things that can be done by dedicated engineering teams. Check out some of the awesome things I've worked on below!</p>

<p>I refuse to ever use lorem ipsum as a placeholder for text which has not yet been written. I mean, of all the things I have to say, I'm going to instead copy and paste in nonsense somebody else wrote in another language? That seems silly. I have so many different thoughts I could be expressing instead, which I'm going to get out into the world whether you like it or not! Like, for example, ever think about how trees might feel about how we use them? I mean, setting aside the fact that we <em>brutally murder</em> them using tools built from <em>melted rocks</em> and powered by <em>the decomposing bones of dinosaurs</em>, and the fact that we went to all that effort just to knock off some trees. No, I mean, the destinations and occupations that trees find themselves in, post-murder. Like, I'm writing this on a desk, made out of wood. All in all, not a bad life for a dead tree. Stable, non-demanding, get to observe interesting comings and goings. Maybe do some light reading.</p>
<p>But then, there's the tissue box. That poor sucker. What did he ever do to deserve that.</p>
<p>Do trees have religion? If I was a tree, I would <em>totally</em> declare myself an all-powerful prophet based on this principle. "If you're good, you, and your tree-wife, and all your tree-children, are going to be bonded together as adjacent plywood plys for all eternity. But if you're bad...well, there's this hole in the ground called a toilet. You don't want anything to do with that."</p>
<p>This is what it's like inside my head, all of the time. It's a strange place there.</p> 
<p>Sometimes I think I would have done alright at stand-up comedy, if the world shared my extremely specific interests and references. Like, is there a market for humor based around plywood fabrication techniques? Seriously, I'm asking.</p>

                        <h3>Project Summary</h3>

                        <p>Driven by the extreme demand and potentially lucrative markup for curated, sorted, second-hand parts from the adult LEGO enthusiast community, this project aims to maximize the value of every basement bin of dusty, mixed plastic bricks the world over! The end-goal is a machine which takes raw, mixed LEGO bulk, sorting and seperately storing each of the thousands of part varieties, for easy access by customers. All without any of the tedious, demanding, and surprisigly specialized manual labor involved in this task today.</p>
                        <p>Applying an automated solution to a large-scale problem where manual labor represents 90% of the current final product cost comes with plenty of challenges, brought on by the diversity and sheer quantity of components in the LEGO system, and need for strict quality control. The multi-module design calls for a two-stage identification and storage approach to balance spacial efficiency, processing rate, ease of implementation, and mechanical fault-tolerance. Part classification uses both classical computer vision techniques alongside various machine learning approaches. These operate through a consensus protocol, which prioritizes effective reporting of uncertainty over absolute classification accuracy to prevent catastrophic errors.</p>

                        <p>This project is under active development. Extensive work has been performed on the software backbone, particulary in curating a 200,000+ item database containing relevant part information, an inventory control GUI, prototypes of the part classification system, and part flow control simulation to aid development of the system-level design. Mechanical prototyping and detailed module design is also well underway, with signifigant progress towards a scaleable vision cell design, first-order mechanical classification of parts by size to prevent future jams, and the intricate final-stage storage system. </p>

                        <p>Select modules of this project will be serving as my capstone project in Robotics Engineering at WPI</p>

Component choices for propulsion, power, attitude control, structure, and launch subsystems were all specified in detail, working around hard constraints imposed by other subsystems which were considered beyond project scope. Extensive mass budgetary analysis was performed to ensure a self-consistent solution which could perform all required maneuvers and functionality. Competing with five other teams within the class, our design proposal scored the highest, achieving all mission objectives with the lowest overall wet mass and highest minimum/average component TRL.</p>

                        <h3>Project Summary</h3>

                        <p>As part of WPI's intense Unified Robotics course sequence, a partner and myself were challenged to design, construct, and program a mobile robot to perform fuel rod replacement operations in a simulated nuclear power plant, with only a seven week design and build cycle. The robot was required to precisely lift a quarter inch diameter rod from a half inch diameter holder, without allowing the rod to contact the holder's inner walls. The rod then had to be raised and rotated to face one of recepticle for the "spent" rods, using bluetooth to detect which recepticles were free to receive spent rods. After this, the robot had to pick up a new rod from holders on opposite sides of the simulation area, again using bluetooth to detect where new rods would be avaliable, and install the new rod into the original holder, again without contacting its side walls. Floor markings were provided to aid with navigation. Signifigant constraints were imposed on the style of mechanism permissable for use in manipulating the rods, to ensure synergy between our projects and the course material on linkage design.</p>

                        <p>Our robot was designed entirely using Solidworks, and constructed predominantly from laser cut acrylic, with over 40 unique parts, including intricate telescoping linear guides. LINKAGES software was used for initial linkage synthesis, with further detailed layout work done via a parameterized Solidworks sketch. On the electrical side, the system is powered by an arduino mega with a custom I/O shield, which takes data from 15 sensors, including limit switches, potentiometers, photocells, and quadrature encoders. These sensors provide feedback on the robot's navigation, and the state of its various manipulator components. </p>

                        <p>An overarching goal of this project due to the experience within our team was to consciously shift as much complexity to the mechanical domain as possible. The final design has practically no reliance on tuned control loops, as the mechanical system is able to tolerate error and authoritatively complete its tasks relying predominantly on simple digital sensors.</p>

                    <div class="modalelement">
                        <p>At the time, this was an experimental project at my college. The professor learned midway through the term that the problem posed was in fact unsolvable using the basic three-position-synthesis four bar design techniques taught in the course, and retroactively relaxed the requirement that the vertical motion be performed using a pin-jointed linkage. By that time, I had already solved the core problem using more sophisticated linkage synthesis techniques, and challenged myself to see this ambitious design to completion. While the final solution is quite complex, my project team is to date the only group to solve this problem under the constraints as originally specified! And it worked!</p>

                        <p>The final linkage design consists of a nine bar, two DOF linkage, with one passively force-closed joint effectively reducing the degree of freedom to one. The vertical motion is accomplished using an Evans' approximate straight line linkage, coupled with a double-parallelogram four bar to provide parallel motion at the endeffector. Once the vertical travel reaches a set point, a hard stop locks up the Evans' linkage. Continuous rotation of the crank then proceeds to load the Evans' coupler link in tension, which houses the force-closed prismatic joint, forcing it to actuate. As the prismatic joint extends, this change in geometry of the upper parallelogram forces the output link to rotate, completing the deisred rise-then-pivot output motion with a single actuator and degree of freedom. </p>

                        <p>Another novel design element is the holonomic drivetrain coupled with a hexagonal array of six digital photocells for navigation via the black tape on the challenge board. The holonomic design enabled an algorighm to be developed to place the turning circle of the robot at any arbitray (x,y) coordinate relative to the robot's center. This was used to build a lightning-fast line following algorithm where the robot would pivot about any sensor that wandered over the line, precisely aligning itself to the line while in motion. This approach meant our drive base seldom operated at anything but full speed, and was appreciably quicker at navigation than classmates using more conventional approaches</p>

                        <p>Pickup is dramatically simplified via the compliant passive gripper. The pickup operation requires no actuation -- the gripper centers itself on the rod and grips it via a pair of friction plates as the linkage lowers itself over the rod. To eject the rod, a linear plunger dubbed the "proboscis" forces the rod out of the gripper.</p>

                        <p>Fun facts:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We named our project named "The One Robot," as it is ring-shaped. The perimeter bears the inscription, in elvish script, "One robot to rule them all, one robot to find them. One robot to bind them here, and of there sleep deprive them." This robot <em>might</em> have been constructed by exhausted nerds.</li>
                            <li>Longest continuous CAD-marathon associated with the build: 32 hours. For the entirety of my birthday that year.</li>
                            <li>The robot earned a place in WPI's RBE program display case, which showcases visually and technically impressive course projects, for four years, the longest such stay I am aware of.</li>
                            <li>It only drove itself off the table once!</li>

                        <h3>Project Summary</h3>

                        <p>A rapid two-week design project for a kinematics course. We were challenged to develop a linkage to artificially "walk" army boots across a load plate, for stress-testing purposes. The focus of the course project was the core kinematics of the linkage, but as a personal project I have since "detailed in" how such a device could actually be constructed, sizing all elements appropriately for a fatigue-loaded system.</p>

                        <p>Kinematics Details</p>

                        <p>The core linkage was the result of an iterative developmnet cycle, with four kinematic layouts explored to varying degrees of depth. The final design is a highly modified Stevenson's six bar linkage, which provides a novel means of decoupling the angular and positional control of the boot. The design can be kinematically decomposed into a grashoff four bar linkage, which traces a coupler curve typical of a boot's motion. This linkage's coupler point is superimposed over a grounded rocker link, which is coupled to the four bar via a sliding joint. The boot is constrained positionally to the four bar's coupler point, but angular position follows the rocker link, such that over the extremes of the four bar's motion, the boot's angle precisely lands at the correct "heel down" and "toe down" angles as specified.</p>

                        <p>I refuse to ever use lorem ipsum as a placeholder for text which has not yet been written. I mean, of all the things I have to say, I'm going to instead copy and paste in nonsense somebody else wrote in another language? That seems silly. I have so many different thoughts I could be expressing instead, which I'm going to get out into the world whether you like it or not! Like, for example, ever think about how trees might feel about how we use them? I mean, setting aside the fact that we <em>brutally murder</em> them using tools built from <em>melted rocks</em> and powered by <em>the decomposing bones of dinosaurs</em>, and the fact that we went to all that effort just to knock off some trees. No, I mean, the destinations and occupations that trees find themselves in, post-murder. Like, I'm writing this on a desk, made out of wood. All in all, not a bad life for a dead tree. Stable, non-demanding, get to observe interesting comings and goings. Maybe do some light reading.</p>
<p>But then, there's the tissue box. That poor sucker. What did he ever do to deserve that?</p>
<p>Do trees have religion? If I was a tree, I would <em>totally</em> declare myself an all-powerful prophet based on this principle. "If you're good, you, and your tree-wife, and all your tree-children, are going to be bonded together as adjacent plywood plys for all eternity. But if you're bad...well, there's this hole in the ground called a toilet. You don't want anything to do with that."</p>
<p>This is what it's like inside my head, all of the time. It's a strange place there.</p> 
<p>Sometimes I think I would have done alright at stand-up comedy, if the world shared my extremely specific interests and references. Like, is there a market for humor based around plywood fabrication techniques? Because actually...wow that is NOT a pleasant experience for the trees. But seriously, I'm asking.</p>
