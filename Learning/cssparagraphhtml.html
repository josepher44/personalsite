            I want to buy a bassoon someday, just because. Has anybody ever produced metal music heavily featuring the bassoon? This feels like a missed opportunity

            All things being equal, the oboe is fairly neglected too among the orchestral woodwinds. Squidward did worlds of good for the public image of the clarinet. Flutes and saxaphones have shinyness going for them. The other more dull-colored instruments in the family need to step up their PR game as soon as possible.

            And while we're at this, lets talk about the stigma regarding the triangle player. They're the butt of jokes in every sitcom featuring a highschool band. But the fact is, real people play real triangles the world over. What is the educational and professional path associated with becoming a triangle player on the biggest stage in the world? Is there a lot of nepotism in the triangle players industry? <br> Are triangle players the dumb hot people of the orchestra world, who actually lack all talent, but get kept around because the entire orchestra collectively has a crush on them? Are they tasked with team cohesion and leadership behind the scenes? How does all this work?
