                <p>By adams or some guy with a wig</p>
                <p>Anyways, I guess, we should have some kind of system?</p>
                <p>Sorta. No big deal. Don't want to commit to anything.</p>
                <p>Like, no king. Definitely no king. Unless George-o wants it, then he can be supreme chancellor</p>
                <p>Okay you're falling into prequels again. Don't do that</p>
                <p>Trade. Yes, trade, that's something we should be worried about</p>
                <p>It should happen</p>

                <h2>Article 3</h2>
                <p>By adams or some guy with a wig</p>
                <p>But, like, we don't want to MAKE you make it happen? No pressure, man</p>
                <p>Like, we're not going to incentivize anything, with taxes or the like</p>
                <p>But, like, we need to support ourselves</p>
                <p>So, I guess, give us money? Pretty please</p>
                <p>Maybe we should sell adds. That zuckerberg fellow seemed onto something</p>
                <p>Oh shit, this Shay fellow is a dick.</p>
