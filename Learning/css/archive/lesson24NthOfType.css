/* Pseudo-selectors: extend normal element selection, generally a subset of . 
 * Things like action on click, hover, etc.
 * Or things like a specific subsection of a <li> or <p>, or filter out parent classes expected to have children but are empty
*/

/*format is .class:keyword*/

/*Can be applied to class, element, or id*/

/*First, last ,nth child
 * Note that nth child goes by all elements, not all elements of given type. 2 here skips headers
 * Instead, use first-of-type
 * Also, nth child doesn't go into children, it simply refers to instance count. For example, in 
 * <ul>
 *      <li></li>
 *      <li></li>
 * </ul>
 * to select second li, you do li:nth-child(2). This is because it targets li tags which are the child of...something.
 * p i:first-child would be first i child of each p element
 */

/*Nth of type gets nth child of type given, skipping elements not of its type.
 * This would matter if articles were interrupted by something else*/
